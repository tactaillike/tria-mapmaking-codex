# Main Settings
![](../../../assets/images/explorer_mainsettings.png)

The main settings contain, well, all the main things about your map: name, description, image ID for your map thumbnail, max time in seconds (after which all players who havenâ€™t beaten the map are killed, you can set this up to 10 minutes), and map difficulty number. There are 7 main difficulties:

1. Easy
2. Normal
3. Hard
4. Insane
5. Extreme
6. Divine
7. Eternal
