![](../../../assets/images/explorer_materials.png)

The materials settings allows you to switch between Robloxâ€™s new, 2022 materials or continue using the older ones, which TRIA.os uses by default. You can also insert MaterialVariants into the Materials folder if you want to use custom PBR materials.
